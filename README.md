# Gideon
An automated personal assistant

## Requirements:
 - A computer running Windows 7 or higher
 - A folder hierarchy where the Gideon file is at the root of it and Gideon's resources are at "\Computer-Resources\PortableApps\Gideon"
 - A Windows defender exclusion for the location of Gideon and it's resources (Add exclusions to any other anti-malware software that is installed on your computer; you do not want the software to mistake the app for a virus or other malware)
 - Generate your own wolfram alpha id and weather api key for use with gideon (these are to be saved in the 'IDs.txt' file located in Gideon's resources)

## Suggestions:
 - Have an internet connection (this improves the tts engine used and makes it sound less robotic)
 - Setting up a task to run Gideon at startup in Task Scheduler helps ease of use as you won't need to start the program manually

## Instructions for use:
   Ensure you have saved your IDs and API keys in the 'IDs.txt' file
1. Launch the application
2. Make Gideon listen to you by clicking on Gideon's icon in the system tray
3. Say anything, if Gideon recognises what you say as a command, they will answer you. If not, Gideon will just wait until a command is given.
